Taking a turn on data science here, trying to more learn by myself. Posted today my notebook/dataset on git, that I processed and analised. 
A pack of random simple cvs data, using decision tree, random tree, SVM, XGBoost and GrisSearchCV. I was experimenting, the probability that I used something in the wrong way is really high, but:

How can I tell if I'm doing it right? How can I even pin the things I should focus on getting better?
Thanks :))
